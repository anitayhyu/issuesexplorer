# GitHub Issues Explorer

GitHub Issues Explorer allows you to view repos’ issues filterable by their state! 

## The Basic Run Down 

This app allows you to search for repos’ issues by their url.  It will display the search results by the default state, which is “all issues.” The user can then filter by state and check out the “open issues,” “closed issues,” and “pull requests.”

## Installation

Use npm install to make sure all dependencies are there.

```bash
npm install axios bootstrap
```
